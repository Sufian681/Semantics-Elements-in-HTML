          <h2>Facts About AI</h2>
          <p>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human
            intelligence in machines designed to think, learn, and adapt like
            humans. At its core, AI aims to enable computers to perform tasks
            that traditionally required human cognitive abilities, such as
            problem-solving, decision-making, language understanding, and even
            creativity. With the rapid advancements in machine learning, deep
            learning, and neural networks, AI systems have become increasingly
            sophisticated, enabling innovations in a variety of fields,
            including healthcare, finance, education, and entertainment. AI's
            ability to analyze vast amounts of data quickly and accurately has
            unlocked new possibilities for automation, predictive analytics, and
            personalized experiences.

            Despite its promising potential, AI also raises significant ethical,
            social, and economic concerns. The growing dependence on AI
            technologies has sparked debates about privacy, security, and the
            impact on employment as automation replaces certain human jobs.
            There are also concerns about the biases embedded in AI algorithms,
            as these systems often reflect the data they are trained on, which
            can perpetuate inequalities. As AI continues to evolve, it is
            essential to strike a balance between innovation and responsible
            usage, ensuring that these technologies are developed and
            implemented in ways that benefit society as a whole while mitigating
            the risks they may pose.
